## Introduction to Git

Git is a **Version Control System (VCS)** designed to make it easier to have multiple versions of a code base,
sometimes across multiple developers or teams.

### Why bother learning it? 

::: {.incremental}
- üòå To sleep in peace 
- üò≠ To not start crying while deploying
- ü§∏üèª To not be dependent on a machine
:::


## What is Version Control System?

**VCS** allows you to centrally create a *Repository* to store your code so that many people (you can define authentication) can access the code and make changes to it simultaneously. 

### But if many people make changes simultaneously, won‚Äôt it get confusing for the code?

No, because Git systems use various functions such as branches, commits, pull requests, merges, etc. to manage the code.

## Introduction to GitHub 

GitHub is a web-based platform that utilizes Git for version control, enabling developers to host, manage, and collaborate on software projects in a centralized repository accessible over the internet.

## Functionalities of GitHub

Apart from the core **Git** functionalities, GitHub allows us to:

::: {.incremental}
- Create organization accounts
- Make private repositories
- Host websites directly<sup>*</sup>
- Integrate CI/CD actions for a better deployment experience
- Use GitHub Co-pilot as a coding assistant

## Alternatives to GitHub

- GitLab
- Beanstalk
- AWS CodeCommit, etc.

## Creating your own repo {.scrollable}

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign up
2. Click on the *New* button to create a repo
![New Repo](./assets/new-repo.png "a title")
3. Create a new repo by filling out the details
![New Repo](./assets/repo-info.png "a title")
4. You can now clone the repository to your local computer using *Git* commands 
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishnaglodha/About-me
```
![clone](./assets/clone.png "a title")
5. You can now make changes to the existing files or add new files. 
![change](./assets/change.png "a title")
If you are using an IDE like *VS Code, Pycharm, etc.*, it will automatically detect that you have made a change.
6. Commit and push the change to the central repo.
You can do that from the IDE or via the terminal.

```bash
# Add the file in which the change has been made
git add . # In this case, I just added all files

# Commit to the repo by adding a message 
git commit -m 'Made change in readme'

# Push to the repo
git push 
```

## Contributing to others' repos {.scrollable}

**Open Source** is a big part of the software development world, which means software developers like us contribute to existing projects to fix bugs and add new features. 

1. Let's fork a repo available at [https://github.com/spatialops/who-attended-presentation](https://github.com/spatialops/who-attended-presentation)
![fork](./assets/fork.png "a title")

*Forking* simply means copying all the content of a repo from someone else's account to our account. 
![forked](./assets/forked.png "a title")

2. Make changes as you want and commit to the repo. 
![addedname](./assets/addedname.png "a title")
But these changes are only part of the repo that you have in your account, not the original one.
3. To add these changes to the original repo, you will need to raise a *Pull Request* (PR)
![pr](./assets/pr.png "a title")
![prmade](./assets/prmade.png "a title")
4. Once PR is raised, the owner of the original repo can work on your PR by either accepting, rejecting, or asking for changes, etc.
![checkpr](./assets/checkpr.png "a title")
5. Once PR is merged, it will be added to the main repo
![prmerge](./assets/prmerge.png "a title")
